<stage>On the sea-shore, in the Tauric Chersonese, near a temple of Artmeis.</stage>
<sp n="Iphigenia">
<speaker>Iphigenia</speaker>
<p>Pelops, son of Tantalus, coming to <placeName key="perseus,Pisa">Pisa</placeName> with swift horses, married Oenomaus' daughter, and she gave birth to Atreus, whose children are Menelaus and Agamemnon; from him I was born, <milestone ed="p" n="5" unit="line"/> his child Iphigenia, by the daughter of Tyndareus. Where Euripus rolls about its whirlpools in the frequent winds and twists the darkening waves, my father sacrificed me to Artemis for Helen's sake, or so he thought, in the famous clefts of <placeName key="perseus,Aulis">Aulis</placeName>. <milestone ed="p" n="10" unit="line"/> For there lord Agamemnon mustered his expedition of a thousand ships of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>, wanting to take the crown of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> in glorious victory and avenge the outrage to Helen's marriage, doing this favor for Menelaus. <milestone ed="p" n="15" unit="line"/> But when he met with dreadful winds that would not let him sail, he went to burnt sacrifices, and Calchas had this to say: &ldquo;"Lord and general of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>, Agamemnon, you will not set free your ships from land until Artemis has your daughter Iphigenia <milestone ed="p" n="20" unit="line"/> as a victim. For you once vowed to sacrifice to the torch-bearing goddess the most beautiful creature brought forth that year; then your wife, Clytemnestra, bore a child in your house&mdash;ascribing the prize of beauty to me&mdash;whom you must sacrifice.&rdquo; And by the craft of Odysseus, <milestone ed="p" n="25" unit="line"/> they took me from my mother, pretending a marriage with Achilles. I came to <placeName key="perseus,Aulis">Aulis</placeName>; held up high over the altar, I, the unhappy one, was about to die by the sword; but Artemis gave the Achaeans a deer in exchange for me and stole me from them; conducting me through the bright air, <milestone ed="p" n="30" unit="line"/> she settled me here in the land of the Taurians. A barbarian rules this land of barbarians: Thoas, who runs as quickly as the flight of birds, and so he received his name for his swiftness of foot. Artemis has made me the priestess in this temple. <milestone ed="p" n="35" unit="line"/> Here I begin the rites, which the goddess delights in, of a banquet noble in name only&mdash;I am silent as to the rest, for I fear the goddess&mdash; &lsqb;for I sacrifice, by a custom of the city established earlier, any Hellene who comes to this land.&rsqb; <milestone ed="p" n="40" unit="line"/> But others carry out the sacrifices, not to be spoken of, within the temple of the goddess.
</p>
</sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="42">
<sp><p>But the strange visions which the night brought with it, I will tell to the air, if that is any relief. I dreamed that I had left this land <milestone ed="p" n="45" unit="line"/> to live in <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, and to sleep in the midst of the maidens' rooms; but the earth's back was shaken by a tossing swell. When I escaped and stood outside, I saw the cornice of the house fall, and the whole roof hurled in ruins on the ground, from the highest pillars. <milestone ed="p" n="50" unit="line"/> One support of my father's house was left, I thought, and it had yellow locks of hair waving from its capital, and took on human voice. In observance of the art of slaughtering strangers that I practice here, I gave it holy water as if it were about to die, while I wept. <milestone ed="p" n="55" unit="line"/> This is my interpretation of this dream: Orestes, whom I consecrated by my rites, is dead. For male children are the supports of the house; and those whom I purify with holy water die. &lsqb;I cannot connect this dream to my friends, <milestone ed="p" n="60" unit="line"/> for Strophius, when I perished, had no son.&rsqb; Now I wish to give libations to my brother, though he is absent from me&mdash;for I would be able to do this&mdash;with the attendants given me by the king, Hellene women. But why <milestone ed="p" n="65" unit="line"/> are they not yet here? I will go inside this temple of the goddess where I live. <stage>Exit Iphigenia.</stage>

<speaker>Orestes</speaker>
<p>O Phoebus, where have you again brought me into the snare, by your oracles, since I avenged my father's blood by the murder of my mother, and was driven by successive Furies, <milestone ed="p" n="80" unit="line"/> a fugitive, away from the land, and completed many winding courses; and coming to you I asked how I might arrive at an end to whirling madness and my labors, which I have carried out, wandering all over <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>. . . .  <milestone ed="p" n="85" unit="line"/> And you told me to go to the boundaries of the Tauric land,  where Artemis, your sister, has an altar, and to take the statue of the goddess, which is said here to have fallen to this temple from heaven; and, taking it by craft of some stroke of luck, <milestone ed="p" n="90" unit="line"/> to complete the venture by giving it to the Athenian land&mdash;what was to come next was not spoken of&mdash;and if I did this, I would have rest from my labors.

<div1 type="card" n="93">
<sp><p>I have come here, obedient to your words, to an unknown, inhospitable land. I ask you, <milestone ed="p" n="95" unit="line"/> Pylades, for you are my accomplice in this task, what shall we do? You see that the surrounding walls are high; shall we ascend the steps leading up to the house? But how might we escape notice? Or loosening the bronze bars of the door with levers, <milestone ed="p" n="100" unit="line"/> of which we know nothing? If we are caught opening the gates and contriving an entrance, we shall die. No, but before we die, let us escape on the ship in which we sailed here.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pylades</speaker>
<p>Flight is not to be endured, nor are we accustomed to it, <milestone ed="p" n="105" unit="line"/> and we must not bring reproach on the god's oracle; let us leave the temple and hide in a cave which the black sea washes with its moisture&mdash;far from the ship, so that no one, seeing it, may tell the ruler, and then seize us by force. <milestone ed="p" n="110" unit="line"/> But when the eye of gloomy night comes on, then we must dare to take the polished statue from the shrine, by any means. See where between the triglyphs there is an empty space to let ourselves down. The brave endure their labors, <milestone ed="p" n="115" unit="line"/> the cowardly are worth nothing at all.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Orestes</speaker>
<p>Yes, we did not come on a long sea voyage only to undertake a return home before the end; but you have spoken wel, we must obey. We should go wherever we can hide and escape notice. <milestone ed="p" n="120" unit="line"/> For it will not be the god's fault if his sacred oracle falls to the ground without effect. We must endure. <stage>Exeunt Orestes and Pylades.</stage></p></sp></div1>

<p>I have come. What is the news? What is troubling you?

<p>Oh! My servants, how I am involved in mournful dirges, <milestone ed="p" n="145" unit="line"/> in laments unfit for the lyre, of a song that is not melodious, alas! alas! wailing for my family. Ruin has come to me; I am lamenting the life of my brother, <milestone ed="p" n="150" unit="line"/> such a vision I saw in my dreams, in the night whose darkness is now over. I am lost, lost! My father's house is no more; alas for my vanished family, <milestone ed="p" n="155" unit="line"/> alas for the sufferings of <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>! O fate, I had one brother only and you carry him off and send him to Hades. For him, <milestone ed="p" n="160" unit="line"/> I am about to pour over the back of the earth these libations and the bowl of the dead: streams of milk from mountain cows, and offerings of wine from Bacchus, <milestone ed="p" n="165" unit="line"/> and the labor of the tawny bees; these sacrifices are soothing to the dead.</p>
<p><stage>(To a servant)</stage> Give me the golden vessel and the libation of Hades.</p>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="170" unit="line"/> O child of Agamemnon beneath the earth, I send these to you as one dead.

<p>I will sing for you, my mistress, responsive songs and <milestone ed="p" n="180" unit="line"/> a barbarian cry of Asian hymns; this song, dear to the dead, <milestone ed="p" n="185" unit="line"/> Hades sings in laments, in chants&mdash;not songs of triumph. Alas for the house of the Atreidae; the light of their scepter, alas, of the ancestral house, is lost. Once they ruled <milestone ed="p" n="190" unit="line"/> as prosperous kings in <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, but troubles dart out from troubles: Pelops, on his horses swiftly whirling, made his cast; the sun changed from its seat the holy beam of its rays. <milestone ed="p" n="195" unit="line"/> One pain comes after another, to the house of the golden lamb. . . .  from that earlier time when the Tantalids were killed, <milestone ed="p" n="200" unit="line"/> punishment came to the house, and fate presses what you do not want upon you.</p></sp></div1>

<p>From the beginning my fate was unhappy, from that first night of my mather's marriage; <milestone ed="p" n="205" unit="line"/>  from the beginning the Fates attendant on my birth directed a hard upbringing for me, wooed by Hellenes, the first-born  child in the home, <milestone ed="p" n="210" unit="line"/> whom the unhappy daughter of Leda, by my father's fault, bore as a victim and a sacrifice not joyful, she brought me up as an offering. In the horse-drawn chariot, <milestone ed="p" n="215" unit="line"/> they set me as a bride on the sands of <placeName key="perseus,Aulis">Aulis</placeName>, oh woe, a wretched bride for the son of the Nereid, alas!

And now I must forget these things, <milestone ed="p" n="230" unit="line"/> and lament my brother, killed in <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, whom I left at the breast, still a baby, still an infant, still a young child in his mother's arms and at her breast, <milestone ed="p" n="235" unit="line"/> the holder of the scepter in <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, Orestes.</p></sp></div1>

<p>Look, here comes a herdsman, who has left the shores of the sea to bring you some new message.</p></sp>

<p>Daughter of Agamemnon, and of Clytemnestra, hear a strange report from me.</p></sp>

<p><milestone ed="p" n="240" unit="line"/> And what is amazing in your news?</p></sp>

<p>Two young men have come to this land, fleeing the dark Symplegades in their ship, an offering and sacrifice pleasing to the goddess Artemis. Be quick to prepare <milestone ed="p" n="245" unit="line"/> the purifications and the first offerings.</p></sp>

<speaker>Herdsman</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="255" unit="line"/> We came to wash our cattle in the salt water.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Iphigenia</speaker>
<p>Go back to the earlier question, how did you take them, and in what way, for I want to know this. They have come after a long time; the altar of the goddess has not yet been reddened by streams of Hellene blood.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="260">
<sp n="Herdsman">
<speaker>Herdsman</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="260" unit="line"/> When we were driving the cattle, that feed in the forest, into the sea that flows through the Symplegades, there was a broken cleft, hollowed by the constant surge of waves, shelter for those who hunt the purple-fish. Here one of the herdsmen saw two youths, <milestone ed="p" n="265" unit="line"/> and made a retreat on tip-toe. He said: &ldquo;Don't you see them? These are deities that sit there.&rdquo; One of us, who revered the gods, lifted up his hands and prayed, as he saw them: <milestone ed="p" n="270" unit="line"/> &ldquo;O son of the sea-goddess Leukothea,  guardian of ships, lord Palaemon, be propitious to us! Or do you sit on our shores, twin sons of Zeus? Or the darlings of Nereus, father of the chorus of fifty Nereids?&rdquo;</p>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="275" unit="line"/> Another, who was foolish and bold in his lawlessness, laughed at the prayers and asserted that ship-wrecked sailors were sitting on the cliff, in fear of our custom, having heard that we sacrifice strangers here. Most of us thought that he spoke well, <milestone ed="p" n="280" unit="line"/> and that we ought to hunt down the customary offerings to the goddess. At this moment, one of the strangers left the rock, and stood, shaking his head up and down and groaning, with hands trembling, wandering in madness; and like a hunter, he cried aloud: <milestone ed="p" n="285" unit="line"/> &ldquo;Pylades, do you see her? Don't you see hell's dragon, how she wants to kill me, fringed with her dreadful vipers against me? and the one who breathes fire and slaughter from her robe and wings her way, my mother <milestone ed="p" n="290" unit="line"/> in her arms&mdash;the rocky mass, how she hurls it at me! Ah, she will kill me! Where can I escape?&rdquo; We could not see these shapes; but he alternated the sounds of sheep and howling of dogs . . .  to send forth the Furies' imitations.
</p>
</sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="295">
<sp><p><milestone ed="p" n="295" unit="line"/> Astonished, we cowered together and sat in silence; but he drew his sword and rushed like a lion into the midst of our cattle, striking their flanks with his iron sword and thrusting it into their sides, thinking in this way to ward off the Furies, <milestone ed="p" n="300" unit="line"/> so that the waves of the sea blossomed red with blood. And all of us, as we saw our herds falling and ravaged, took arms, blew our conch shells, and collected the neighbors; for we thought cowherds would make a poor fight of it <milestone ed="p" n="305" unit="line"/> against well-grown and young foreigners. After a long time, our numbers were complete. But the stranger fell down, his pulsing beat of madness gone, his chin dripping with foam; when we saw him, so conveniently fallen, each of us went to work, <milestone ed="p" n="310" unit="line"/> hurling and striking at him.  The other stranger wiped off the foam and tended his body, covering him with a finely-woven robe, looking out for the attacking blows, treating his friend kindly with his care. <milestone ed="p" n="315" unit="line"/> The stranger, now in his senses, started up from his fall and realized the surge of enemies close at hand and the present danger to them both, with a groan; we did not let up our attack with stones, pressing hard from all sides. <milestone ed="p" n="320" unit="line"/> Then we heard his dreadful exhortation: &ldquo;Pylades, we shall die, but let us die with glory; draw your sword, and follow me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Very well. You go and bring the strangers here; the holy rites will be my concern. <stage>Exit Herdsman.</stage></p>
<p>O my unhappy heart, you were gentle to strangers before, <milestone ed="p" n="345" unit="line"/> and always full of pity, measuring out tears for the sake of our common race, whenever Hellenes came into your hands. But now, after those dreams that have made me savage, thinking that Orestes is no longer alive, <milestone ed="p" n="350" unit="line"/> whoever comes here will find me harsh to them. This is true after all, my friends, I have realized: the unfortunate, when themselves doing badly, do not have kind thoughts towards those who are more unfortunate. But no breeze from Zeus ever came, <milestone ed="p" n="355" unit="line"/> or a boat, bringing Helen here, through the rocks of the Symplegedes&mdash;Helen who destroyed me, with Menelaus, so that I might avenge myself on them, setting an <placeName key="perseus,Aulis">Aulis</placeName> here against that one there, where the Danaids overpowered me and were going to sacrifice me like a calf, <milestone ed="p" n="360" unit="line"/> and my own father was the priest. Ah me!&mdash;I cannot forget those past evils&mdash;how often did I stroke my father's cheek and, hanging on his knees, told him: &ldquo;O father, I am brought <milestone ed="p" n="365" unit="line"/> to a shameful betrothal by you; but while you are killing me, my mother and the <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> women are singing wedding hymns, and the whole house is filled with the music of flutes; but I am being destroyed by you. For Achilles was Hades after all, not the son of Peleus, <milestone ed="p" n="370" unit="line"/> whom you held out to me as a husband, and you brought me in a chariot to a bloody wedding by treachery.&rdquo; But I was modestly looking out through a fine veil, and did not take up my brother in my arms&mdash;and now he is dead&mdash;did not kiss my sister, <milestone ed="p" n="375" unit="line"/> because I was going to the house of Peleus; I put off many embraces to another time, thinking that I would come back again to <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>.</p>
<p>My unhappy Orestes, if you are dead, what glories have you left, what achievements of a father! <milestone ed="p" n="380" unit="line"/> I blame the goddess' subtleties; whichever mortal has engaged in murder, or has touched a woman in childbirth or a corpse, she drives from her altars, thinking him impure; but she herself delights in human sacrifices. <milestone ed="p" n="385" unit="line"/> It is not possible that Leto, the wife of Zeus, gave birth to such folly. I judge that the feast prepared by Tantalus for the gods is not to be believed, that they fed on the flesh of his son; and I think that the people here, who are themselves killers of men, <milestone ed="p" n="390" unit="line"/> ascribe to the goddess their sorry behavior.

<p>By the gods, Pylades, do you feel the same thing I do?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pylades</speaker>
<p>I do not know; I have no reply to your question.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Orestes</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="660" unit="line"/> Who is the girl? How like a Hellene she questioned me about the labors in <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilium</placeName> and the return of the Achaeans, and Calchas, wise in omens, and Achilles' name; and how she pitied the wretched Agamemnon, and asked me about <milestone ed="p" n="665" unit="line"/> his wife and children!  This stranger is an <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> by race, and from that land; or she would not be sending the tablet and examining these things, as if she had some share in <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>' prosperity.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pylades</speaker>
<p>You are not much ahead of me: I was about to say the same things you said, <milestone ed="p" n="670" unit="line"/> except this: all who move about in the world know what happens to kings. But I have arrived at another consideration.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Orestes</speaker>
<p>What is it? Share it with me so that you may know better.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pylades</speaker>
<p>It is shameful for me to live when you are dead; <milestone ed="p" n="675" unit="line"/> I sailed together with you, and I ought to die together with you. For I will seem a coward and base in <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,4003963">Phocis</placeName> of the many mountain folds. Most will think&mdash;for most people are base&mdash;that I betrayed you and saved myself to come home alone, <milestone ed="p" n="680" unit="line"/> or I plotted your death, in the afflictions of your house, for the sake of your kingdom, since I married your sister and heiress. I fear these things and I am ashamed; and I must breathe my last with you, <milestone ed="p" n="685" unit="line"/> be slaughtered with you and consumed on the pyre; because I am your friend and I fear reproach.</p></sp></div1>

<speaker>Orestes</speaker>
<p>Hush! I must bear my own ills, and when the grief is single, I will not bear it double. What you call vile and infamous, <milestone ed="p" n="690" unit="line"/> would be mine, if I cause you, who have toiled with me, to die; for it is not a hardship for me, suffering as I do at the hands of the gods, to give up my life.  But you are prosperous, and you have a house that is pure, not afflicted, while mine is impious and unfortunate. <milestone ed="p" n="695" unit="line"/> If you are saved and get sons from my sister, whom I gave to you for wife, my name would remain and the whole house of my father would not be wiped out in childlessness.

Report that I died at the hand of an <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> <milestone ed="p" n="705" unit="line"/> woman, at an altar, purified for death. Do not ever betray my sister, when you see how lonely is my father's house that you have joined by marriage. And now farewell; I have found you the dearest of my friends, you who have hunted with me, grown up with me, <milestone ed="p" n="710" unit="line"/> and borne with me many miseries.</p>
<p>Phoebus, though a prophet, has deceived me; creating his plot, he drove me far away from <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>, ashamed of his earlier prophecies.

<sp>
<speaker>Pylades</speaker>
<p>You will have a tomb, and I will never betray your sister's bed, unhappy youth, since I will hold you dearer when dead than when alive.

Great misfortune can offer great reversals, when it is fated; it can indeed.</p></sp>

<p>I will tell you; this is the beginning of my many troubles. <milestone ed="p" n="940" unit="line"/> When my mother's evil deeds, that I cannot speak of, came into my hands, I was driven to flight by the Furies' pursuit; then Loxias sent me to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, to stand trial with the goddesses who may not be named. <milestone ed="p" n="945" unit="line"/> For there is a holy tribunal there, which Zeus once established for Ares, when his hands were stained with blood-pollution. I came there . . . at first, no host would willingly take me in, as one hated by the gods; then some who felt shame offered me a table apart, as a guest, <milestone ed="p" n="950" unit="line"/> themselves being under the same roof, and in silence they kept me from speaking, so that I might be apart from them in food and drink, and into each private cup they poured an equal measure of wine and had their delight. <milestone ed="p" n="955" unit="line"/> And I did not think it right to blame my hosts, but I grieved in silence and seemed not to know, while I sighed deeply, that I was the murderer of my mother. I hear that my misfortunes have become a festival at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, and they still hold this custom <milestone ed="p" n="960" unit="line"/> and the people of Pallas honor the cup that belongs to the Feast of Pitchers.</p>
<p>When I came to the hill of Ares to stand my trial, I took one seat, and the eldest of the Furies took the other. I spoke and heard arguments on the murder of my mother, <milestone ed="p" n="965" unit="line"/> and Phoebus saved me by bearing witness; Pallas counted out equal votes for me; and I went away victorious in my ordeal of blood. Some of the Furies who sat there, persuaded by the judgment, marked out a holy place for themselves beside this very tribunal; <milestone ed="p" n="970" unit="line"/> but others were not persuaded by the law, and drove me always in vagabond courses until I came to the holy plain of Phoebus in turn. Stretched out before his shrine and fasting, I swore to break off my life and die there, <milestone ed="p" n="975" unit="line"/> if Phoebus, who had destroyed me, did not save me. And then Phoebus cried out a golden voice from the tripod, and sent me here, to get the image Zeus hurled down, and set it up in Athena's land. But what he marked out for my safety <milestone ed="p" n="980" unit="line"/> you must help me with; for if we possess the statue of the goddess, I will be released from madness and will put you on my ship of many oars and establish you again in <placeName key="perseus,Mycenae">Mycenae</placeName>.

If I am separated from this, I am lost, but you might settle your affairs well and have a safe return. Indeed, I do not shrink from it, not even if I must die <milestone ed="p" n="1005" unit="line"/> to save you.

<p>Ah! These women told me that you were outside; they would have driven me away from the temple, <milestone ed="p" n="1310" unit="line"/> but you were inside after all.</p></sp>

<speaker>Thoas</speaker>
<p>What advantage were they expecting and hunting after?</p></sp>
<sp>

<p>I will tell you about them later; hear what is currently at hand. The girl who presided at this altar, Iphigenia, has left the country <milestone ed="p" n="1315" unit="line"/> with the strangers, and takes with her the holy statue of the goddess; the purification was a cheat.</p></sp>

<p>Do not think of that, but listen to me; consider it clearly and when you hear, devise a pursuit to hunt down the strangers.</p></sp>

<p>When we came to the sea-shore, where Orestes' ship was moored in hiding, <milestone ed="p" n="1330" unit="line"/> Agamemnon's daughter motioned to those of us you sent with the strangers' bonds to stand far off, as if her sacrifice of purifying flame, that she had come for, were secret. But she went on alone, holding the strangers' chains in her hands, behind them. Your servants, lord, were suspicious, <milestone ed="p" n="1335" unit="line"/> but we allowed it. After a while, so that we might think that she was accomplishing something, she raised a shout, and chanted strange songs and spells, as if she were washing off the pollution of murder. When we had sat a long time, <milestone ed="p" n="1340" unit="line"/> it occurred to us that the strangers, loosed from their bonds, might kill her and escape by flight. But we were afraid of seeing what we ought not, and sat in silence. But at length we all resolved to go where they were, although we were not allowed.</p>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="1345" unit="line"/> There we saw a Hellene ship, winged with ready blade for the stroke, and at the oar-locks were fifty rowers with their oars; the two youths stood by the stern, freed from their chains. <milestone ed="p" n="1350" unit="line"/> Some were holding the prow in place with poles; others were fastening the anchor from the cat-heads; others were drawing the stern-cables through their hands, and making haste to let down the ladders into the sea for the strangers. Without sparing ourselves, when we saw <milestone ed="p" n="1355" unit="line"/> their treacherous wiles, we seized the priestess and the cables, and tried to draw the ship's rudder-oars out through their holes. Then there was a debate: &ldquo;What is your reason for carrying the statue and the priestess away from the land by theft? <milestone ed="p" n="1360" unit="line"/> Who is your father, who are you, to smuggle her away?&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;Know that I am Orestes, her brother, Agamemnon's son, and I have come to take my sister, whom I lost from her home.&rdquo;
</p>
</sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="1364">
<sp><p>But we held her no less, <milestone ed="p" n="1365" unit="line"/> and were leading her to you by force, for which I received these dreadful blows on my cheeks; they had no swords, nor did we. Both the youths gave rattling blows with their fists, <milestone ed="p" n="1370" unit="line"/> darting their limbs against our sides and breasts, so that as soon as we joined battle, we were worn out. We were fleeing to the cliff, stamped with dreadful marks, some with bloody wounds on their heads, others on their eyes; <milestone ed="p" n="1375" unit="line"/> when we stood on the on the heights, we fought more cautiously and hurled rocks at them. But, standing on the stern, the archers with their arrows kept us off and drove us away. And now an immense swelling wave ran the ship aground, <milestone ed="p" n="1380" unit="line"/> and the maiden was afraid to get her feet wet. Orestes bore his sister on his left arm, going into the sea and quickly up the ladder, and he set her on the ship, along with the statue of Zeus' daughter, fallen from heaven. <milestone ed="p" n="1385" unit="line"/> From the middle of the ship, he cried out: &ldquo;Sailors of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>, seize the ship with the oars and make the waves white with foam; for we possess those things for which we sailed the inhospitable straits, within the clashing rocks.&rdquo;

<div1 type="card" n="1390">
<sp><p><milestone ed="p" n="1390" unit="line"/> They gave a cheerful shout, and struck the salt wave. The ship, while it was within the harbor, was headed for the mouth; but when it had crossed, it met with a violent swell aand was hard pressed; and the wind, rising with sudden dreadful gusts, <milestone ed="p" n="1395" unit="line"/> forced it astern. They beat the waves strongly; but the swell was driving the ship back towards the land. Agamemnon's daughter stood up and prayed: &ldquo;O daughter of Leto, bring me, your priestess, safely to <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName> <milestone ed="p" n="1400" unit="line"/> from this barbaric land, and forgive my thefts. For you, goddess, love your brother; believe that I love mine also.&rdquo; The sailors shouted the paean in response to her prayer, and applied their naked shoulders <milestone ed="p" n="1405" unit="line"/> to the oars, at the command. But the ship came nearer and nearer to the rocks; some of us rushed into the sea, others grasped the woven ropes. And I set out here to you at once, lord, <milestone ed="p" n="1410" unit="line"/> to tell you what has happened there.</p>
<p>But go, take chains and nets with you; for if the swell does not become calm, there is no hope of safety for the strangers. <milestone ed="p" n="1415" unit="line"/> Revered Poseidon, ruler of the sea, watches over <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> and is hostile to the race of Pelops; he will now allow you and your citizens, as is right, to have in your hands the son of Agamemnon and his sister; she stands convicted as betrayer of her unremembered sacrifice to the goddess in <placeName key="perseus,Aulis">Aulis</placeName>.</p></sp>

<p>All citizens of this barbarian land, hurl the reins on your horses, rush to the coast and seize what the Hellene ship <milestone ed="p" n="1425" unit="line"/> casts forth!

So that by sea and with pursuit on horseback by land, you may take them; and hurl their bodies from the hard rock, <milestone ed="p" n="1430" unit="line"/> or impale them on the stake.</p>
<p>As for you women, who knew about these plots, I will punish you later, when I am at leisure. But now in this present urgency, I will not remain still.</p></sp></div1>

<p><milestone ed="p" n="1435" unit="line"/> Where, where are you carrying this pursuit, lord Thoas? Listen the words of Athena, who is here. Cease to follow or to send an army pouring forth; for Orestes came here, destined by the oracles of Loxias, to flee from the anger of the Furies, <milestone ed="p" n="1440" unit="line"/> and to bring his sister to <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName> and take the holy statue to my land, thus gaining a release from his present miseries. Thoas, I am speaking to you: you expect to take Orestes in the sea-swell and kill him; but Poseidon, for my sake, <milestone ed="p" n="1445" unit="line"/> now lets him sail over the back of the waveless sea.</p>
<p>And you, Orestes, attend to my commands, for you hear the goddess' voice even though not present: go away with the statue and your sister; and when you come to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, built by the gods, <milestone ed="p" n="1450" unit="line"/> there is a place on the farthest borders of the Attic land, neighbor to the ridge of Carystia, sacred, and my people call it <placeName key="tgn,5004271">Halae</placeName>. There build a temple and set up the image in it; it will have its name from the Tauric land and from your labors, <milestone ed="p" n="1455" unit="line"/> which you have endured, wandering through <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName> and goaded by the Furies. And mortals will in future times celebrate Artemis Tauropolos with hymns. And establish this law: whenever the people keep the festival, let a sword be held <milestone ed="p" n="1460" unit="line"/> to a man's throat and draw out blood, in atonement for your sacrifice, so that the goddess may have her honors, and holiness is revered. You, Iphigenia, must be key-holder for this goddess on the hallowed stairs of <placeName key="perseus,Brauron">Brauron</placeName>, and will die there and be buried; <milestone ed="p" n="1465" unit="line"/> and they will dedicate adornment to you, finely-woven robes which women who have died in childbirth leave in their homes. I charge you to send these Hellene women to their country, for their correct intentions. . . . For I saved you <milestone ed="p" n="1470" unit="line"/> before also, Orestes, on Ares' hill when the votes were equal; and this will be the custom, for the one with equal votes to win. But, son of Agamemnon, take your sister away from this land. And you, Thoas, do not be angry.</p></sp></div1>
